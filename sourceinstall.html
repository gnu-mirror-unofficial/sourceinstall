  <a href="#TOCintroduction" id="introduction">Introduction to GNU Source Installer</a>
</h4>

<p>
  <b>GNU Source Installer</b> (sourceinstall) is a source package installer and manager for Unix-likes.
</p>
<p>
 It provides configuration, compilation, installation, upgrade, tracking and removal of packages built from source code. The functionality is reachable using a command line, scriptable front end or a GTK graphical interface.
</p><p>
 This program is meant to install source code as provided by the original developers (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, no system-specific packages); packages built using the GNU autotools (<a href="/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>, <a href="/software/automake/automake.html">automake</a>, <a href="/software/libtool/libtool.html">libtool</a>, ...) are the primary target of this tool, but packages supporting the common configure options and makefile conventions are also supported.
</p><p>
For an user already experienced with source installations from the plain shell (using the ./configure, make, make install sequence), this software provides a way to centralize source installation, have easier access to configure options, keep track of already installed packages and their relevant files, check installations for consistency, export and reuse installation information and have enhanced uninstallation and upgrade functionalities.
</p><p>
For the novice but interested user, this software also offers a way to gain confidence with the shell commands, the file system, the traditional Unix commands, and of course with common source configuration and installation procedures and options. Reporting bugs encountered during build remains easy, with the full log available in both front-ends.
</p><p>
The software is targeted at Unix-like systems, and should work on most of them, with GNU/Linux as the primary target. Please report any portability problem you should encounter.
</p>

<h4>
  <a href="#TOCdownloading" id="downloading">Downloading GNU Source Installer</a>
</h4>

<p>
  The most recent release is 2.1, and is an official alpha release.
  It contains most of the main features, but still misses documentation and 
  extensive testing. Please consider helping the project in this regard.
</p><p>
  All sourceinstall 2.1 components are available separately:
  a library, called libsrcinst-2.1, which must be installed first, then the
  command line front end, called sourceinstall-2.1, and finally the 
  GTK graphical front end, called sourceinstall-gtk-2.1.
  You can install either of these front-ends or both, depending on your taste.
</p>
<p>
  The older releases are marked 0.x, and are going to be completely obsolete
  soon. You can fetch GNU Source Installer using one of the following methods:
</p>
<div class="quadro">
  <p><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/sourceinstall/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/sourceinstall/</a> [via FTP].</p>
  <p>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/sourceinstall co sourceinstall [via anonymous <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=sourceinstall">CVS</a>].</p>
</div>
<p>
  It can also be found on one of <a href="/prep/ftp.html">our FTP mirrors</a>.

<h4>
  <a href="#TOCdocumentation" id="documentation">Documentation</a>

<p>
  Unfortunately, a complete updated manual for 2.1 is still not available,
  and help is needed in this sense. For 0.x the full manual can be obtained at
  <a href="/software/sourceinstall/manual/manual.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/sourceinstall/manual/manual.html</a> [warning! Only for versions 0.x].
