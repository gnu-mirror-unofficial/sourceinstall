Welcome to GNU Source Installer!

   <p><samp><span class="command">sourceinstall</span></samp> automates configuration, compilation, installation and removal of source packages, using the common procedures used to install Unix
software.

   <p>Provided your system meets the requirements, and thus you manage to have a working installation of <samp><span class="command">sourceinstall</span></samp> itself, you will be shortly able to install new software from its source code by:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>surfing the web
<li>identifying a Free program you like
<li>downloading its SOURCE package (in .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or other formats)
<li>feeding it to GNU Source Installer (<samp><span class="command">sourceinstall</span></samp>)
        </ol>

<h3 class="section">1.1 Installing the Installer</h3>

<p><a name="index-Installing-the-Installer-2"></a>
If you reached this manual, you probably already have a working, maybe minimal system and a browser.

   <p>Proceed to download sourceinstall-0.1-cvs.tar.gz, and mark where the file will be placed (the &ldquo;folder&rdquo;, or in more proper language a <dfn>directory</dfn>). For example, we will assume that you are downloading to

<pre class="example">     /home/user/downloads
</pre>
   <p>After the download completes, start a console session. Your desktop environment should include a button, picture, or menu item that refers to a &ldquo;shell&rdquo;, &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; or &ldquo;console&rdquo;.

   <p>After the console is open, you should see a brief message ending in $; this message will be represented here by a single dollar character, and you  shall NOT type that character as part of the commands.

   <p>Reach the directory you just downloaded your file in, by typing in the shell this command, followed by a RETURN:

<pre class="example">     $ cd /home/user/downloads
</pre>
   <p>If you get an error message, double check your command for typos. 
If things are going well, you will know because you will get nothing else than another $ ended message (a <dfn>prompt</dfn>)

   <p>At this point enter the following command (this assumes you have the GNU version of <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp>):

<pre class="example">     $ tar -zxvf sourceinstall-0.1-cvs.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p>Note that you can use the tabulation (TAB) character to complete names. Experiment with pressing (TAB) around the middle of the file name.

   <p>All the files you'll see are being extracted from the archive, and a new directory is being created in the current one. At the end type:

<pre class="example">     $ cd sourceinstall-0.1-cvs
     $ ./configure
</pre>
   <p>A lot of output will be showing at this point. The software is being <dfn>configured</dfn> (adapted) for your system. If everything runs smooth, you will see at most WARNINGs but no ERRORs. After a while you will get the familiar dollar, and now you can write:

<pre class="example">     $ make
</pre>
   <p>Some output will be shown, then again the familiar prompt. And now:

<pre class="example">     $ su
     (Enter your root password)
     # make install
</pre>
   <p>After writing <code>su</code>, you will be asked for your root password. 
You should have set your root password during your Operating System initial setup. If you do not know, try pressing ENTER. 
The # character before <code>make install</code> denotes the fact that after <code>su</code> you have gained root privileges. Since you are done, drop your root privileges by typing

<pre class="example">     # exit
</pre>
   <p>Each time you want to run GNU Source Installer from the console, type:

<pre class="example">     sourceinstall
</pre>
   <p>To run it from the graphical environment, you should create a link to the program on your desktop or in your program menus. The program to link is
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/sourceinstall</span></samp>

   <p>If you experience errors, or behaviour not described correctly by this manual, the next section tries to deal with these cases.

   <p>If you read this section and the next one, and still cannot follow these instructions, there is probably nothing GNU Source Installer can do for you, and you should stop reading here.

   <p>At the end of the procedure you will get the following files installed:

   <p><samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/sourceinstall</span></samp>                (link to the program)
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/sourceinstall.tcl</span></samp>            (the program)
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/info/sourceinstall.info</span></samp>          (texinfo manual)
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/man/man1/sourceinstall.man</span></samp>       (man page)

   <p>To consult the GNU Source Installer manual type

<pre class="example">     $ info sourceinstall
</pre>
   <p>If you want a brief overview of program invocation and options, you can consult the traditional man page by issuing

<pre class="example">     $ man sourceinstall
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">1.2 Troubleshooting <samp><span class="command">sourceinstall</span></samp> Installation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Troubleshooting-_0040command_007bsourceinstall_007d-Installation-3"></a>
If you could not install GNU Source Installer, this is most likely because you do not have the required software in your system.

   <p>Look at the output of <code>./configure</code>, and you will see which programs have not been found on your system.

   <p>The most blocking thing is if you miss <samp><span class="command">tclsh</span></samp>: in this case <code>./configure</code> will exit with an error, and <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> will not be able to run.

   <p>If this is your case, you will need to install tcl. If you have your OS installation disk(s), chances are that tcl is available there, and is installable using the OS specific installation system.

   <p>Otherwise, a source release can be obtained from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl">http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl</a>. 
See the documentation provided by the tcl project to obtain a working tcl installation.

   <p>Then restart the procedure from <code>./configure</code> and things should be better.

   <p>If you miss any of the other helper programs, only the particular functionality offered by that program will be missing (a WARNING will be shown).

   <p>This is a comprensive list of programs that GNU Source Installer uses, from the most important ones, to the really secondary:

     <dl>
<dt>tclsh<dd>with the Tk and Expect tcl packages

     <br><dt>sh, cp, mv, rm. du, su, rmdir<dd>these are part of every unix-like, you must have them

     <br><dt>tar<dd>this is necessary to extract the source .tar archive

     <br><dt>bunzip2, bzip2<dd>these are necessary to uncompress .bz2 files and to compress the stored source using the very space efficient (but more time consuming) .bz2 compression. By default, the source is stored using this compression.

     <br><dt>gzip, gunzip<dd>these are necessary to uncompress .gz files and to compress the stored source using the quick but less-than-bz2 (but still good) space efficient .gz compression.

     <br><dt>unzip, zip<dd>these deal with .zip files. It is very unlikely that you will find Free Software source packages available only in .zip format so you can ignore this. Also, you do not want to compress your source using zip. I found both .gz and .bz2 to be much more efficient at least when dealing with source.

     <br><dt>compress<dd>this deals with .Z files, and only to create them to store source. Do you want to store source in .Z ? I think not. So if it is missing on your system, have a laugh and ignore it.

   </dl>

   <p>If you still have problems, you can write an email to the <samp><span class="command">sourceinstall</span></samp> users mailing list <a href="mailto:bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org">bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org</a> and ask for help. 
Feedback of any sort is also welcome.

   <p>Good luck, and I hope this helps :)
