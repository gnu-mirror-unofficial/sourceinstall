<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction for Beginners</h2>

<p><a name="index-Introduction-for-Beginners-2"></a>
This is an introduction for real beginners of source installation. If you are already somewhat experienced with UNIX-like systems and GNU source code install procedures, you should skip this chapter, otherwise

   <p>Welcome!

   <p><span class="command">sourceinstall</span> will try to make configuration, compilation, installation and removal of source packages easier for you as a beginner.

   <p>Instead of hiding information and operations from you, everything that happens will be available for you to see.

   <p>This way, if you are interested you can hopefully understand basic concepts by just looking at the commands executed by this program in the information frame.

   <p>Provided your system meets the requirements, and thus you manage to have a working installation of <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> itself, you will be shortly able to install new software from its source code by surfing the web, identifying a Free Software you like, downloading its SOURCE package, and feeding it to GNU Source Installer.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Installing the Installer</h3>

<p><a name="index-Installing-the-Installer-3"></a>
If you have a fast internet connection, proceed to download sourceinstall-0.5-fullpack.sh or a newer version, and mark where the file will be placed
<a name="index-directory-4"></a><a name="index-folder-5"></a>(the &ldquo;folder&rdquo;, the <dfn>directory</dfn>). You must have the permission to write in that directory. For example, we will assume that you are downloading to

<pre class="example">     /home/user/downloads
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-shell-6"></a><a name="index-terminal-7"></a><a name="index-console-8"></a>After the download completes, start a console session. Your desktop environment should include a button, picture, or menu item that refers to a &ldquo;shell&rdquo;, &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; or &ldquo;console&rdquo;.

   <p>After the console is open, you should see a brief message ending in $; this message will be represented here by a single dollar character, and you shall NOT type that character as part of the commands.

   <p>Reach the directory you just downloaded your file in, by typing in the shell this command, followed by a RETURN:

<pre class="example">     $ cd /home/user/downloads
</pre>
   <p>where of course <span class="file">/home/user/downloads</span> is the directory in which you downloaded the file.

   <p><a name="index-prompt-9"></a>If you get an error message, double check your command for typos. 
If things are going well, you will know because you will get nothing else than another $ ended message (a <dfn>prompt</dfn>).

   <p><a name="index-root-10"></a>At this point, you can decide if you want to install as the super-user (root), or using your ordinary account.

   <p>Installing as root is more indicated for system-wide installs. To do so, type

<pre class="example">     $ su
     (Enter your root password)
</pre>
   <p>At this point run the installer by typing:

   <p>$ /bin/sh sourceinstall-0.5-fullpack.sh

   <p>wait for the package to extract (this might take some minutes on slow or loaded systems), and follow the instructions. After being asked some simple questions, hopefully you will get a working installation of the GNU Source Installer. 
Mark the executable name that is showed at the end of the procedure, because that is the program that you need to run to start the installer.

   <p><a name="index-prefix-11"></a>This setup procedure installs in a subdirectory of your home directory by default if you are using an ordinary account. In particular, by default the installation <dfn>prefix</dfn> (the directory subtree in which to install) is ~/usr, where ~ represents your home directory.

   <p>If you are using a root account, then the setup procedure will instead use /usr/local as the default prefix. This is a common prefix for system-wide installs.

   <p>If you have a fast internet connection and want the easiest install, you can skip the rest of this section, and jump to the &ldquo;Troubleshooting&rdquo; section if you experiece any problems during installation.

   <p>If you are a bit more daring, instead, you can try a normal source release. 
The releases whose names end in -fullpack are many megabytes in size, because they contain all the major dependencies in source form, and it could be that you already have the required packages. 
<br>
You can fetch the much smaller sourceinstall-0.5.tar.gz (or other version). 
We will assume the same destination directory as above for the download.

   <p>At this point enter the following command (this assumes you have the GNU version of <span class="command">tar</span>):

<pre class="example">     $ tar -zxvf sourceinstall-0.5.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p>or, if you do not have the GNU version of <span class="command">tar</span> (f.e. Solaris):

<pre class="example">     $ gunzip sourceinstall-0.5.tar.gz
     $ tar -xvf sourceinstall-0.5.tar
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-tabulation-12"></a>Note that you can use the tabulation (TAB) character to complete names. Experiment with pressing (TAB) around the middle of the file name.

   <p>All the files you'll see are being extracted from the archive, and a new directory is being created in the current one. At the end type:

<pre class="example">     $ cd sourceinstall
     $ ./configure
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-configuration-13"></a>A lot of output will be showing at this point. The software is being <dfn>configured</dfn> (adapted) for your system. If everything runs smooth, you will see at most WARNINGs but no ERRORs. After a while you will get the familiar dollar, and now you can write:

<pre class="example">     $ make
</pre>
   <p>Some output will be shown, then again the familiar prompt. And now:

<pre class="example">     $ su
     (Enter your root password)
     # make install
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-root-password-14"></a>After writing <code>su</code>, you will be asked for your root password. 
You should have set your root password during your Operating System initial setup. If you do not know, try pressing ENTER. 
The # character before <code>make install</code> denotes the fact that after <code>su</code> you have gained root privileges. Since you are done, drop your root privileges by typing

<pre class="example">     # exit
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-run-sourceinstall-15"></a>Each time you want to run GNU Source Installer from the console, type:

<pre class="example">     sourceinstall
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-shortcut-16"></a><a name="index-link-17"></a>
To run it from the graphical environment, you should create some kind of &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; or &ldquo;link&rdquo; to the program on your desktop or in your program menus. The program to launch is (assuming a root installation and default values) <span class="file">/usr/local/bin/sourceinstall</span> .

   <p>If you experience errors that prevent the correct installation and execution of the program, the next section tries to deal with these cases.

   <p>At the end of the procedure you will get the following files installed:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/sourceinstall</span>                (link to the program)
<li><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/sourceinstall.tcl</span>            (the program)
<li><span class="file">/usr/local/info/sourceinstall.info</span>          (texinfo manual)
<li><span class="file">/usr/local/man/man1/sourceinstall.man</span>       (man page)
        </ol>

   <p><a name="index-info-18"></a>To consult the GNU Source Installer manual type

<pre class="example">     $ info sourceinstall
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-man-19"></a>If you want a brief overview of program invocation and options, you can consult the traditional man page by issuing

<pre class="example">     $ man sourceinstall
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">1.2 Troubleshooting Installation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Troubleshooting-Installation-20"></a>
If you could not install GNU Source Installer, this is most likely because you do not have the required software in your system. In other cases, it could be a bug in the installation procedure.

   <p>For the -fullpack releases, it is most likely the second (the special -fullpack release is meant to install without dependency errors).

   <p>If you need to report a bug that prevented the correct installation of a -fullpack, please provide all the files ending in .log and .err that are generated during the procedure.

   <p>To find all these .log and .err files, after getting the error during installation, look in the directory in which you ran the procedure. In our example, it was:

   <p><span class="file">/home/user/downloads</span>

   <p>You should find a <span class="file">sourceinstall-fullpack</span> directory there. It is a directory created during installation, that is removed after the operation and only if it completed correctly. In your case, if you have an error during the procedure, the directory will still be there. That directory should contain many files whose names end in .err and .log . These are the files to attach to your bug report. As always, report your bugs to <a href="mailto:bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org">bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org</a> .

   <p><a name="index-sourceinstall-dependencies-21"></a>If you are using a normal release (not a fullpack), look at the output of <code>./configure</code>, instead, and you will see if some needed programs have not been found on your system.

   <p>The most blocking thing is if you miss <span class="command">tcl</span>, <span class="command">Tk</span> or <span class="command">Expect</span>: in this case <code>./configure</code> will exit with an error, and <span class="command">make</span> will not be able to run.

   <p>If this is your case, you will need to install tcl, tk and/or expect (or try the -fullpack release instead). If you have your OS installation disk(s), chances are that the software is available there, and is installable using the OS specific installation system.

   <p>Otherwise you should fetch and build the Tcl, Tk and Expect source packages. 
You can fetch Tcl and Tk from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/</a>, while Expect is available at <a href="http://expect.nist.gov/">http://expect.nist.gov/</a> . 
They are a bit tricky to install, so if you cannot find your way out of them, you can always revert to the -fullpack release.

   <p>If you succeed in building a working Tcl/Tk/Expect environment, restart the procedure from <code>./configure</code> and things should be better.

   <p>If you miss any of the other helper programs, only the particular functionality offered by that program will be missing (a WARNING will be shown).

   <p>This is a comprensive list of programs that GNU Source Installer uses, from the most important ones, to the really secondary:

     <ul>
<li>tcl interpreter
<span class="command">tclsh</span> with the Tk and Expect tcl packages, or in alternative the all-in-one <span class="command">expectk</span> interpreter. If Tk is not present, you will still be able to use sourceinstall through the command line, but trying to launch the graphical interface will report an error.

     <li>sh, cp, mv, rm, du, su, rmdir, ln, find, make
These should be provided by your Unix-like OS. You must have them for GNU Source Installer to work correctly.

     <li>tar
this is necessary to extract the source .tar archive - in theory you could use GNU Source Installer without this, but in practice you will need it.

     <li>gzip, gunzip
these are necessary to uncompress .gz files and to compress the stored source using the quick and space-efficient .gz compression.

     <li>bunzip2, bzip2
these are necessary to uncompress .bz2 files and to compress the stored source using the very space-efficient (but more time consuming) .bz2 compression. By default, the source is stored using this compression.

     <li>ps
this command is used to better detect other sourceinstall processes. GNU Source Installer also uses a lock file, so it is not really necessary.

     <li>unzip, zip
these deal with .zip files. It is very unlikely that you will find Free Software source packages available only in .zip format so you can ignore this. Also, you do not want to compress your source using zip. I found both .gz and .bz2 to be more efficient at least when dealing with source. Ignore warning if not present.

     <li>compress
this deals with .Z files. The gzip utilities are used to uncompress .Z packages, so you would only need this if for some arcane reason you want to store source in .Z format. Ignore warning if not present.

     <li>chmod, chown
these are used by the very experimental (and pointless?) binary package export feature.

   </ul>

   <p>If you still have problems, you can write an email to the <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> users mailing list <a href="mailto:bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org">bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org</a> and ask for help. 
Something that can help a lot is reporting the full output of

<pre class="example">     $ ./configure
</pre>
   <p>Feedback of any sort is also welcome. 
Good luck, and I hope this helps :)

<h2 class="chapter">2 Introduction for the Experienced</h2>

<p><a name="index-Introduction-for-the-Experienced-22"></a>
GNU Source Installer (<span class="command">sourceinstall</span>) is a complete source package management tool, that handles source package configuration, installation, tracking and removal, information querying and export.

   <p>It is intended to work on modern Unix-like systems (with <code>GNU/Linux</code> as a primary target).

   <p>This is a tool intended for the user, not for developers: it has nothing to do with package creation. It helps people install and manage software packages in source form.

   <p>The user installs new source packages by browsing the web, downloading a source package (in .tar.gz or other formats), and then feeding it to the source installer.

   <p>There are two different ways to interact with <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>: a Tk graphical interface, and a command-line driven, non-interactive interface.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Why should you use this program?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Why-should-you-use-this-program_003f-23"></a>
If you already build most of the software on your system from source code, you might try <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> nonetheless. Here is what this software offers to the experienced user:

     <ul>
<li>a centralized way of handling source installations

     <p>even if you have no problems building from source code, you can use <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> as a way to centralize and better organize your source installations.

     <li>a GUI and a complete command line interface,

     <p>that should satisfy the needs of many. The GUI interface also shows all output of the underlying command line tools called, and displays information about installed packages and available actions and preferences, so nothing will be hidden from you. The command line interface and the GUI are functionally equivalent.

     <p>Scripts can interface with GNU Source Installer at the executable level, by using the command line interface.

     <li>tracking of all currently installed source packages,

     <p>with info about install size, source size, and all files relevant to each package. 
<br>
Yes, you can build everything from source directly using ./configure, make, make install, but <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> helps you remember which configure parameters you used back then to configure that package, helps you after installation by tracking the executable to run, the available documentation, etc from a handy file list, offers editable package descriptions, and other features.

     <li>automatic quick check for broken installs.

     <p>If a file associated with an installed package goes missing, then (Tk interface) clicking on the package will prompt the problem, and mark the missing file with big warnings. If you can not solve the issue yourself by restoring the file, you can ask for a fresh reinstallation by clicking &ldquo;Reinstall&rdquo;. The command line <span class="option">--check</span> and <span class="option">--install</span> actions can be used for the same goal.

     <li>implicit check for reliable and gnu-conforming packages.

     <p>The program will issue warnings if the package offers only a very spartane build system, or does not correctly honor common Makefile targets and features.

     <li>full debugging output.

     <p>You will be able to get notified of warnings and errors from <code>./configure</code>, <code>make</code>, and all other programs.

     <li>clean uninstallation.

     <p>The program performs crosschecks between make uninstall results and internal information available on individual packages (gathered during the install process in a clean and portable way). These checks can detect files left over by the make uninstall procedure, and if no other package claims them, they are suggested for removal (Tk interface), or removed directly (cmdline interface).

     <li>portability.

     <p>The program should work on most modern Unices. Even though great care has been taken as to use only very portable code in both the program and its build system, something can slip by, even more since I (the author) do not have other machines than a trusted GNU/Linux box. Just report them: chances are, you will get the portability problem solved sooner than expected. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Why should you avoid this program?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Why-should-you-avoid-this-program_003f-24"></a>
The following is a critique against this tool, that shows what you lose, or do not gain in contrast to relying for example on the good old command line:

     <ul>
<li>you can lose time.

     <p><span class="command">sourceinstall</span> basically installs two times. The program makes a test installation first (if <code>DESTDIR</code> or <code>INSTALL_ROOT</code> are supported), to make a final check and gather useful information. This has an impact on total installation time. It is a necessary overhead to avoid non-portable low level solutions. In addition, other phases you can sometimes skip when running the commands yourself will add up to the total installation time.

     <li>some packages might not work.

     <p><span class="command">sourceinstall</span> has to make some generalizations and will not be able to install difficult packages. An experienced user or developer can quickly go through a broken or sketched <code>Makefile</code> and fix things for his system, but <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> can not. Also, packages which use different installation conventions (for example imake), do not work with <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>. This program actively supports the autotools and the derived build system. If enough people use this tool, this could further drive developers towards the autotools and to create better packages in general.

     <li>no package-level dependency tracking, no repository, nothing at all.

     <p>This is not a GNU/Linux distribution. It is a source package management tool. 
If your package blocks during configuration, you still look at that error message in the console or pseudo-console and act consequently (generally this involves browsing for that missing file/package). This program does not interact with a repository of &ldquo;installable&rdquo; packages and dependencies.

     <li>people who install everything from source might not give a damn.

     <p>If the benefits shown in the preceeding list do not apply to you, you might prefer to just install from source as you always did. After widespread adoption, however, even less experienced users than you could be able to approach the source packages (and hopefully become more experienced with time).

   </ul>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Invoking</h2>

<p><a name="index-Invoking-25"></a>
This chapter shows the various actions, options, parameters and preferences that <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> accepts.

<h3 class="section">3.1 Synopsis</h3>

<p><a name="index-Synopsis-26"></a>
<pre class="example">     sourceinstall
     
     sourceinstall  ACTION [ ACTION_ARG... ]
                    [ OPTION [ OPTION_ARG... ]... ] [ PACKAGE_NAME ]
     
     sourceinstall  [ OPTION [ OPTION_ARG... ]... ] FILENAME
</pre>
   <p><span class="command">sourceinstall</span> can be run in three different ways.

   <p>If called without any arguments, the program starts a graphical interface and waits for user input to decide the action to perform. This is what beginners should probably do.

   <p>The second way of calling the program is the complete command line interface, where a single action must be specified, followed by zero or more options, possibly followed by a final <span class="option">PACKAGE_NAME</span> if the action requires it.

   <p>The third way of calling the program is without specifying any actions, and with a required <span class="option">FILENAME</span>.

   <p>This is for both convenience and backward compatibility, and is a shortcut for the <span class="option">--add</span> action with no custom package name.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Actions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Actions-27"></a>Only ONE action can be specified on the command line. The action may require one or more parameters.

   <p>Some actions require a <span class="option">PACKAGE_NAME</span> on which to act, while others behave differently if such a <span class="option">PACKAGE_NAME</span> is specified.

   <p>For example, the <span class="option">--export</span> action can export information about all installed packages or about a single package, depending on whether a <span class="option">PACKAGE_NAME</span> is specified.

   <p>As another example, the <span class="option">--add</span> action adds a new package to the <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> package list (a very common operation). If <span class="option">PACKAGE_NAME</span> is specified, then the new package will be called <span class="option">PACKAGE_NAME</span>. Otherwise, a default value is obtained from the top source directory of the package.

     
<a name="index-_002dh-28"></a>
<a name="index-_002d_002dhelp-29"></a>
<dl><dt><span class="option">-h, --help</span><dd>show brief command line help

     <p><a name="index-_002dV-30"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dversion-31"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-V, --version</span><dd>show program version

     <p><a name="index-_002dl-32"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dlist-33"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-l, --list</span><dd>list existing packages;
<br>
if PACKAGE_NAME is specified, it is treated as a regular expression, and only matching package names are included in the output. The regular expression is a tcl ARE. Tcl regular expressions have been implemented using the package written by Henry Spencer, based on the 1003.2 spec and some (not quite all) of the Perl5 extension. 
<br>
Packages are separated by newlines, and a short description is shown near the package name if such a description is available. Package name and description are separated by a &ldquo; - &ldquo; (space, dash, space) sequence.

     <p><a name="index-broken-pipe-34"></a><a name="index-pipe-35"></a><a name="index-more-36"></a><a name="index-pager-37"></a>You might be tempted to pipe the output to a pager. If you do, and have expect-5.43 installed, avoid <span class="command">more</span>. There is a bug in that Expect version that causes problems with pipes, and you will get a <dfn>broken pipe</dfn> error with more. Expect-5.41 does not show this problem.

     <p><a name="index-_002da-38"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dadd-39"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-a, --add FILENAME</span><dd>add new source package from FILENAME;
<br>
this is the way to add and install new source packages, so you will use this often. Note that this is not the same as the <span class="option">--install</span> action, which only acts on an already added (but uninstalled) package.

     <p>The <span class="option">--add</span> action configures, builds and installs the source code referenced by FILENAME, then stores the configured source code and saves package information. The unique package name will be taken from the top source directory by default, but can be specified using PACKAGE_NAME (look at the SYNOPSIS above).

     <p>Note that since the source code is automatically stored (in the <span class="file">~/.sourceinstall/src</span> directory) you can safely remove FILENAME after a successful <span class="option">--add</span> action.

     <p>All the above assumes the default behaviour. It can be altered by Options and Preferences.

     <p><a name="index-_002dr-40"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dremove-41"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-r, --remove</span><dd>remove source package PACKAGE_NAME;
<br>
by default, the <span class="option">--remove</span> action removes both installation and stored source code. In this case, after removal the package will not exist anymore, and its name will not show in the package list. You can instead fine grain what gets removed by using the <span class="option">--binary</span> or <span class="option">--source</span> options.

     <p><a name="index-_002dc-42"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dcheck-43"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-c, --check</span><dd>show package PACKAGE_NAME information;
<br>
if the package is currently installed, validation on known installed files is performed, signaling eventually missing files. If the check reports some missing files, you can rely on the <span class="option">--install</span> action to reinstall over the broken installation.

     <p><a name="index-_002dv-44"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dupdate-45"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-v, --update OLD_PACKAGE FILENAME</span><dd>remove package OLD_PACKAGE completely, then add FILENAME as a new package. 
<br>
As for the <span class="option">--add</span> action, the new package name will be taken from the top source directory by default, or from PACKAGE_NAME if specified. 
<br>
This action is nothing more than a twofold <span class="option">--remove</span> / <span class="option">--add</span> action.

     <p><a name="index-_002di-46"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dinstall-47"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-i, --install</span><dd>install known package PACKAGE_NAME from stored source code. 
<br>
This action is not the way to deal with a new package. If you want to add a new package, you want to use the <span class="option">--add</span> action instead.

     <p><a name="index-_002du-48"></a><a name="index-_002d_002duninstall-49"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-u, --uninstall</span><dd>this is an alias for -r -b . 
<br>
This action only removes the installation, but not the source code. Useful to remove something you might wish to restore at a later date. If you want to remove and completely forget about a package, use the <span class="option">--remove</span> action instead.

     <p><a name="index-_002dd-50"></a><a name="index-_002d_002ddescription-51"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-d, --description STRING</span><dd>associate first line of STRING to package PACKAGE_NAME short description,
<br>
and the remaining lines to the long description. 
<br>
If STRING is empty, remove descriptions from the package. 
<br>
To submit an empty string, or a string containing newlines, make use of your shell quotation characters. Two examples (bash):

     <pre class="example">          $ sourceinstall -d "STFU - Shoot The Fighters Up space game
          &gt; This game is the famous SDL based STFU space game, where lots of noisy
          &gt; enemy fighters dance through the screen making every kind of disturbing
          &gt; crappy sound. Using overpowered weapons, you can finally bring them to
          &gt; silence, and restore peace to the galaxy." STFU
     </pre>
     <p>Here we add a package description to the package STFU. The first line will be
the short description, and the rest of the multiline text is called the long
description. The descriptions will show everytime the <span class="option">--list</span> and <span class="option">--check</span> actions are requested (see those actions for further info).

     <pre class="example">          $ sourceinstall -d "" STFU
     </pre>
     <p>Here we remove all the descriptions (both short and long) from the STFU package. The <span class="option">--list</span> and <span class="option">--check</span> actions will not show any descriptive text anymore.

     <p><a name="index-_002dn-52"></a><a name="index-_002d_002drename-53"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-n, --rename OLD_NAME</span><dd>rename existing package OLD_NAME to PACKAGE_NAME.

<br>
FORMAT can be xml, txt or lst . The xml format and txt format contain all the package information, while the lst format only exports the installed files list (and thus has only sense when applied to an installed package). 
<br>
If a PACKAGE_NAME is specified, then only the information regarding PACKAGE_NAME is exported. If no PACKAGE_NAME is present on the command line, information about all known packages is exported (xml and txt formats only).

     <p><a name="index-_002dp-56"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dpack-57"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-p, --pack FILENAME</span><dd>build binary tarball from the installed package PACKAGE_NAME, and save it as FILENAME. 
<br>
Permissions and ownership are preserved. This functionality is experimental, unstable, slow, sketched. You will need to have or acquire root privileges to complete this operation. 
</dl>

<h3 class="section">3.3 Options</h3>

<p><a name="index-Options-58"></a>Many options can be specified on the command line, but each option can be chosen only once. Options modify specific actions' behaviour. 
<br>
Some of these options overlap with the preferences in the sourceinstall configuration file, and could even overlap with the package information. These command line options take precedence in these cases.

     
<a name="index-_002ds-59"></a>
<a name="index-_002d_002dsource-60"></a>
<dl><dt><span class="option">-s, --source</span><dd>apply add or remove action to source only. 
<br>
During an <span class="option">--add</span> action, use this option to specify that you do not want the software to be installed, but only want to store the source internally for future needs. You can combine this with the <span class="option">--configure</span> option to prepare a configured source package and then store it for later use. 
<br>
During a <span class="option">--remove</span> action, use this option to specify that you want only the source code to be removed. If the package is currently installed, this leaves only the binary installation, without the stored source code that generated it. If you have enough disk space, it is recommended to keep the source code.

     <p><a name="index-_002db-61"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dbinary-62"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-b, --binary</span><dd>apply add or remove action to installation only. 
<br>
During an <span class="option">--add</span> action, use this option to skip the &ldquo;store source code&rdquo; phase. If you have enough disk space, it is recommended to keep the source code.

     <p><a name="index-_002dt-63"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dstrip-64"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-t, --strip</span><dd>strip binaries during installation if possible (not recommended)

     <p><a name="index-_002dz-65"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dcompression-66"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-z, --compression FORMAT</span><dd>use FORMAT as compression format for storing source code. Can assume values gz, bz2, Z . 
<br>
This overrides the <span class="option">SRC_COMPRESS</span> preference .

     <p><a name="index-_002dC-67"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dconfigure-68"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-C, --configure STRING</span><dd>(re)configure package using STRING. 
<br>
First char of STRING cannot be a '-'. This is worth saying because a common usage of the <span class="option">-C</span> option is to override the default installation prefix set in the Preferences. The command line parser will take your &ldquo;&ndash;prefix&rdquo; string for another option and will complain about a missing <span class="option">-C</span> parameter. To avoid this, just prepend your configuration string with a harmless space. 
<br>
You can take the habit to prepend a space to every configuration string you submit, and you will be fine. Here is an example:

     <pre class="example">          $ sourceinstall --install -C " --prefix=/home/claudio/usr" unshield-0.5
     </pre>
     <p>Note that if you want to submit some environment variables to configure, a nice way to do it is to specify them in the configure STRING. This way they will appear in the package information. For example:

     <pre class="example">          $ sourceinstall --add cmdftp-0.9.2.tar.gz -C " CFLAGS=-Os LDFLAGS=-s"
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-_002dD-69"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dsubdir-70"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-D, --subdir STRING</span><dd>use STRING as build subdirectory for the package. 
<br>
Some packages' build system is nested in some subdirectory. Use this option to specify a directory to move to before configuring and building the package. 
<br>
This is a real example with tcl source package, that has a unix subdirectory that contains the configure script. Trying to build it normally gives:

     <pre class="example">          $ sourceinstall --add tcl8.4.11-src.tar.gz -C " --enable-shared --disable-threads --enable-symbols"
          sourceinstall: warning in `Configuration': A configure script for this package has not been found in the top source directory. However, configure scripts have been found in subdirectories
          
          unix/configure
          win/configure
          tools/configure
          
          Use the `--subdir' option to specify a build subdirectory containing one of these configure scripts
          # configure script not available
          sourceinstall: warning in `Configuration': configure script not available. Default prefix and configure options will be ignored.
          # compile software
          sourceinstall: error in `Install package': Could not compile the code.
     </pre>
     <p>In this case, the subdirectory to indicate is of course the unix subdirectory:

     <pre class="example">          $ sourceinstall --add tcl8.4.11-src.tar.gz -C " --enable-shared" -D unix
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-_002df-71"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dforce-72"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-f, --force</span><dd>force execution of the action even when not recommended (Not Implemented Yet). 
<br>
Currently this option has absolutely no effect.

     <p><a name="index-_002dU-73"></a><a name="index-_002d_002duser-74"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-U, --user STRING</span><dd>privileged user login to revert to if required [default=root] . 
<br>
When running <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> as a regular user, sometimes privileges will be needed, for example to install to a part of the filesystem that belongs to root, or even to prepare binary packages (see <span class="option">--pack</span> action). 
<br>
You can choose to use a login different than root in these cases, by specifying this option.

     <p><a name="index-_002dP-75"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dpass-76"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-P, --pass STRING</span><dd>privileged user password to revert to if required [default=] . 
<br>
WARNING! USING THIS OPTION IN A MULTIUSER ENVIRONMENT IS VERY INSECURE! 
<br>
When running <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> as a regular user, sometimes privileges will be needed, for example to install to a part of the filesystem that belongs to root, or even to prepare binary packages (see <span class="option">--pack</span> action). 
<br>
You can use this option to specify the password to use in these cases. 
Note however that the program invocation, with all its parameters, could be stored in some log files, or in the system running processes list. 
<br>
If you want to run <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> from the command line in a multiuser environment, you will probably do best by running sourceinstall as the root user.

     <p><a name="index-_002dq-77"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dquiet-78"></a><br><dt><span class="option">-q, --quiet</span><dd>be very quiet: only indispensable information will be sent to the standard output.

   </dl>

<h3 class="section">3.4 Preferences</h3>

<p><a name="index-Preferences-79"></a>
Preferences are very much like options, but they are stored in a specific file that is loaded each time sourceinstall starts.

   <p>Every time a command line option and a preference clash, the command line option takes precedence.

   <p>To change the preferences you can edit your
<span class="file">~/.sourceinstall/sourceinstallrc</span> file. 
<br>
Note that each user (root too!) has his own preferences file.

     
<a name="index-MANUAL_005fCONFIGURE-80"></a>
<dl><dt><span class="option">MANUAL_CONFIGURE: bool</span><dd>(Tk interface only) This preference controls whether the configuration window should be shown in the Tk interface. It has no effect if you are using the command line interface. 
<br>
The <span class="option">bool</span> value can be 0 (do not show configure window) or 1 (do it).

     <p><a name="index-KEEP_005fSOURCE-81"></a><br><dt><span class="option">KEEP_SOURCE: bool</span><dd>This preference controls whether the source code should be stored when adding or installing software. Of course, this preference clashes with options <span class="option">--source</span>, <span class="option">--binary</span>, and their aliases. The <span class="option">bool</span> value can be of course 0 or 1.

     <p><a name="index-INSTALL-82"></a><br><dt><span class="option">INSTALL: bool</span><dd>This preference controls whether the software should be installed when adding software. Of course, this preference clashes with options <span class="option">--source</span>, <span class="option">--binary</span>, and their aliases. The <span class="option">bool</span> value can be again 0 or 1.

     <p><a name="index-ADD_005fDIRECTORY-83"></a><br><dt><span class="option">ADD_DIRECTORY: path</span><dd>(Tk interface only) This preference controls the initial directory <span class="option">PATH</span> to browse when clicking Add.

     <p><a name="index-STRIP-84"></a><br><dt><span class="option">STRIP: bool</span><dd>This preference mimics the <span class="option">--strip</span> option.

     <p><a name="index-PREFIX-85"></a><br><dt><span class="option">PREFIX: path</span><dd>This is the default prefix to use when adding/installing software. Note that you can override this setting by providing a <span class="option">--prefix</span> configure string (see the <span class="option">--configure</span> option). The default value is <span class="file">/usr/local</span>, a safe choice for systemwide installs.

     <p><a name="index-SRC_005fCOMPRESS-86"></a><br><dt><span class="option">SRC_COMPRESS: format</span><dd>This is another preference that mimics an option. In this case it is the <span class="option">--compression</span> option.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Usage for Beginners</h2>

<p><a name="index-Usage-for-Beginners-87"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.1 The default setup</h3>

<p><a name="index-The-default-setup-88"></a>
For beginners, a default setup known to work well for GNU Source Installer is the following:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>GNU Source Installer is installed system-wide as the root user in a different prefix than your OS distribution. For example <span class="file">/usr/local</span>. 
<li>You login normally as you always do with your user name, then start the GNU Source Installer using command <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>, which starts the graphical interface. You do NOT login as root. 
At the appropriate times, during installation, you will be asked for the root password if necessary. 
<li>The default prefix in your preferences is <span class="file">/usr/local</span>, and thus you install your source packages in <span class="file">/usr/local</span>
<li>You are the only one on the system that installs source packages, and always do that logging in as the same user. 
<li>When you need to remove or upgrade <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>, login as root and run the program. You will see GNU Source Installer listed in the root user's packages and will be able to manage it.
        </ol>

<h3 class="section">4.2 Looking for the right package</h3>

<p><a name="index-Looking-for-the-right-package-89"></a>
First of all, think about a software you want. It is highly probable that such a software package is available under a Free license somewhere.

   <p>You can search by simply using a web search engine.

   <p>Tip: add GPL or another Free license name to your search, so you are sure to find real Free Software, and not freeware, shareware or whatelse. 
You can also try the term &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo;.

   <p>The Free Software and Open Source movements have different goals, but
search engines tend to find pages with the term &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in no-cost,
while free software is about freedom.

   <p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html</a> explains the relationship further.

   <p>You can choose another road, and use a Directory instead. 
Good places to start are the Free Software Directory and Savannah (home to the <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> project development). Other good places to search are Freshmeat and Sourceforge, although you will find a lot of not really Free software there too.

   <p>Once you have found an interesting software, look for a SOURCE download (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, ..) 
Proceed with the download, and mark where the file will be downloaded.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Adding a new source package</h3>

<p><a name="index-Adding-a-new-source-package-90"></a>
Once you have a new shiny source package, it is time to add it from the Source Installer. Run <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>, then press the <code>Add</code> button.

   <p>In the <code>Add</code> dialog that appears, you can choose <code>Browse</code> to locate the package, and finally choose <code>Ok</code> to proceed. Let the other checkboxes be with their default values.

   <p>If everything runs smooth and the package has been built with the autotools, you will be presented with a configuration window, where all package options can be tweaked prior to installation.

   <p>If you have no idea about what those options mean, at least take a look at the option descriptions. You can then try 'Auto' to go on with the defaults.

   <p>The option <span class="option">--prefix</span> will be highlighted. This is because it's a very useful and important option, that lets you specify where your install tree should start.

   <p>When you are satisfied with the options, choose <code>Ok</code> and wait for the software to be configured and compiled.

   <p>If no problems occur, you will be eventually asked for the root password (if needed), and then you will be informed about the result of the install operation.

<h3 class="section">4.4 Changing the Preferences</h3>

<p><a name="index-Changing-the-Preferences-91"></a>
The default prefix to use for your installs can be changed, like other options, in the <code>Preferences</code> from the <code>Edit</code> menu, and it is initially set to <span class="file">/usr/local</span>.

   <p>Here are the preferences you can change and their description:

   <p>&ldquo;Default installation choices: Manual configuration, Install, Keep Source&rdquo;
These are the default values for the checkboxes when you trigger the <code>Add</code> action. Beginners should keep all those selected.

   <p>&ldquo;Manual configuration&rdquo; means that you will be able to see the software configuration window. It will get you aquainted with the common options supported by the packages, so it is recommended to keep this selected.

   <p>You can always choose <code>Auto</code> in the configuration window to stick with the defaults.

   <p>&ldquo;Install&rdquo; means that when you add new packages, they will be installed. Most beginners would want this.

   <p>&ldquo;Keep Source&rdquo; means that the configured source code is compressed, archived and stored for later use. This does waste some space, but ensures a cleaner uninstall process, and can provide a future easy reinstallation.

   <p>&ldquo;Strip binaries (not recommended)&rdquo;: this option should be off. It can cause a lot of trouble if you don't know what you are doing. It involves removing symbolic information from the installed programs.

   <p>&ldquo;Default install prefix&rdquo;: this is the default prefix to use when installing software packages. Programs and data will generally be installed in a subtree of the specified directory. The default value is <span class="file">/usr/local</span> and is a good one for system-wide installs.

   <p>&ldquo;Src compression&rdquo;: this is the compression format to use when archiving source packages. By default it is .bz2 (which provides very space-efficient compression), but if you have plenty of space in your disk and prefer quicker installs and uninstalls you can change it to .gz

<h3 class="section">4.5 Querying package information</h3>

<p><a name="index-Querying-package-information-92"></a>
Clicking on the package will show all available information on that package, and will activate the actions for the installed package: <code>Remove</code> and <code>Reinstall</code>. This will also trigger a quick check to ensure that the package has all its needed files in place.

<h3 class="section">4.6 Removing a package</h3>

<p><a name="index-Removing-a-package-93"></a>
To remove a package, select it from the list and click the <code>Remove</code> button. 
When you <code>Remove</code> a package, you can decide to uninstall the package but keep it in compressed source form. This way, should you decide to install again later, you have the already configured source, and only need to select it from the list and choose <code>Install</code>.

   <p>These instructions should get you started. 
Read on if you want to know more.

<div class="node">

<br>
</div>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Usage for the Experienced</h2>

<p><a name="index-Usage-for-the-Experienced-94"></a>
A package processed by sourceinstall can exist in three forms:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>installed + archived configured source
<li>installed only
<li>archived configured source only
        </ol>

   <p>For example, if you are short on space, and you are installing a conforming package (so you get a list of installed files in the package details), you can decide to remove the archived source (losing all the advantages though) to free up some space. Alternatively, you can avoid to store it in the first place when you perform the <code>Add</code> action.

   <p>On the countrary, you might think that you do not require a certain installed
program right now, so you select the <code>Remove</code> action for that package, but
remove only the installation and not the source, so you can quickly reinstall should you require the software again in the future. Your configuration will
be preserved, you will not need to pass through the configuration window anymore if you were fine with the last installation.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Consistency checks</h3>

<p><a name="index-Consistency-checks-95"></a>
Another service that <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> offers is a simple set of consistency checks for existing installations. 
<br>
In the Tk interface, selecting a package from the list at any time will show all available information about the installed package, and a check will be performed to see if the install looks ok. If some of the files required by the program are missing, you will find a notice and all the missing files will be highlighted and marked with asterisks (*). 
<br>
The same thing can be obtained from the command line interface using the <span class="option">--check</span> action.

   <p>At this point you can correct the problem by restoring the missing files yourself (for example, you might have accidentally moved them for arcane reasons), or
just reinstall the package, using the <code>Reinstall</code> button of the Tk interface, or the <span class="option">--install</span> action of the command line one.

   <p>Additionally, during the uninstallation cross-checks will be performed between make uninstall results and internal package information; only independent files (that is, files that are not being claimed by other packages) are proposed for removal (Tk interface), or directly removed (command line interface). 
<br>
This works better if you avoid installing non-conforming packages, because Source Installer will not be able to know which files a non-conforming package claims.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Conforming packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-Conforming-packages-96"></a>
It is recommended to install only conforming packages using Source Installer. 
Conforming packages offer a configure script that generates a Makefile, and the Makefile honors the common install targets and environment variables. Generally, packages built (correctly) with the GNU autotools result as conforming packages, and the autotools are also expecially supported: only configure scripts generated with autoconf get the nice configuration window in the Tk interface. However, there are also other tools that developers can use which are capable of producing a configure script and a Makefile. Even hand-written configure scripts and Makefiles are ok, as long as they honor the install targets and the environment variables.

   <p>Conforming packages get better uninstallation, better checks, more information in the Package information window. A single non-conforming package can make uninstallation checks degrade. This is because the program can not detect which files a non-conforming package claims.

   <p>For these reasons, you will be warned when installing a non-conforming package.

<h3 class="section">5.3 Other package management systems</h3>

<p><a name="index-Other-package-management-systems-97"></a>
It is highy probable that you will have many different tools that provide package management. 
For example, if you are running a GNU/Linux distribution, you probably have your distribution-specific way to handle binary (or even source) packages. 
What I suggest here is to make a clean separation between your distribution-provided packages (along with any additional packages installed using your distribution-specific tools), and the source packages installed using the distribution-independent GNU Source Installer. 
One good way to obtain this, is to use different prefixes for each package management system you use. 
Suppose your distribution-handled packages are in <span class="file">/usr</span>, then your source packages managed by GNU Source Installer can be prefixed using <span class="file">/usr/local</span> (this is the initial value). 
This way you ensure that file dependency checks are not tainted by other packages managed by other tools.

<h3 class="section">5.4 Users</h3>

<p><a name="index-Users-98"></a>
GNU Source Installer configuration and packages always refer to the particular user that runs it. What follows is a list of possible setups.

   <p>As the first example, suppose user Pip wants to install his private packages. He chooses to install in <span class="file">/home/pip/usr</span>, at the same time allowing user Merlin to install his own packages in <span class="file">/home/merlin/usr</span>. Of course, in this case no one steps on anybody's toes and everything runs smooth.

   <p>As the second example, user Merlin is the system administrator, and personally deals with all system-wide package installations. Thus, he logs in using his <code>merlin</code> account, then runs <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> and uses the default prefix value, which is <span class="file">/usr/local</span> to install new programs. When requested by the system, he is asked for the root password. This is ideal for one-user systems.

   <p>As a third example, suppose both Pip and Merlin deal with system administration. They get along well, and both deal with system-wide package installations. Thus, they decide to both install packages logging in using the privileged <code>root</code> account, and then install using <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>. They will both see the same packages, because they are logging in as the same user (<code>root</code>). However, only one of the two admins will be able to install software at the exact same time, because to prevent corruption of package data each user is entitled to a single running instance of GNU Source Installer. When the program is already in use, <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> refuses to start and explains the error.

   <p>As a last example, here's what not to do. Imagine both Pip and Merlin deal with system administration, like before, but since they don't read the docs, they login using their regular accounts, and perform installs using the default system-wide prefix, <span class="file">/usr/local</span>, providing the root password when needed. Even if they install at different times this is a bad thing to do: they will not be aware of each other's moves, file dependency tracking will be far less precise, and uninstallation crosschecks will degrade.

<h3 class="section">5.5 Files and Directories</h3>

<p><a name="index-Files-and-Directories-99"></a>
If you want to dwell on the internals of sourceinstall, this is an interesting chapter. We will look at all files and directories that together make sourceinstall work.

   <p>The <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> executable is in fact a symbolic link to the implementation in use. For example:

<pre class="example">     $ ls -l /usr/bin/sourceinstall*
     lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     11 Jun  3 03:15 sourceinstall -&gt; sourceinstall.tcl
     -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  87019 Jun  3 03:15 sourceinstall.tcl
</pre>
   <p>Currently there is only a tcl implementation, but in the future this system will be used to make different implementations of <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> coesist.

   <p>The per user configuration directory is another story:

   <p>each user that runs <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> gets a .sourceinstall directory created in his <span class="env">HOME</span>. This is for example a directory tree:

<pre class="verbatim">
$ tree ~/.sourceinstall
/home/claudio/.sourceinstall
|-- build
|-- install-destdir
|-- packages
|   |-- a-renet-1.1.0rc5
|   |-- cmdftp-0.9.2
|   `-- libmikmod-3.2.0-beta2
|-- src
|   |-- a-renet-1.1.0rc5.tar.bz2
|   |-- cmdftp-0.9.2.tar.bz2
|   `-- libmikmod-3.2.0-beta2.tar.bz2
`-- sourceinstallrc
</pre>

   <p>If sourceinstall were running, you would see another file,
<span class="file">~/.sourceinstall/.sourceinstall_lock</span>, containing the process id of the running sourceinstall process.

   <p>In this case there are only three packages installed. Each package has a file name entry with the same name in the <span class="file">packages</span> directory. That file contains all information on that package.

   <p>The source for all three packaged has been archived in the <span class="file">src</span> directory.

   <p>The <span class="file">install-destdir</span> directory is used during the test installation, and then it is cleared.

   <p>The <span class="file">build</span> directory is used only while building packages, and then it is cleared.

   <p>Do not store anything in these directories yourself, because they will be regularily emptied.

   <p>The <span class="file">sourceinstallrc</span> file contains the current user preferences. These are the same options that can be tweaked from the <code>Preferences</code> in the <code>Edit</code> Menu using the Tk interface.

<h3 class="section">5.6 Export functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Export-functions-100"></a>
<span class="command">sourceinstall</span> contains now some experimental export functions, to offer more interface to other programs (and some user functionalities as well).

   <p>Information about a single package (or about all the packages) can be exported through the <dfn>Export package information to XML</dfn> and <dfn>Export package information to plaintext</dfn> features. The XML involved is a simple XML 1.0 format (look at the XML output for the external public DTD address) and is more machine-oriented, while the plaintext is more user-oriented.

   <p>It is also possible to extract just the list of the files claimed by the installed package, in a plaintext, newline-separated list using the <dfn>Export installed files list</dfn> action.

   <p>A whole different story is the <dfn>Export as binary package</dfn> functionality. Information that follows is very unstable and should not be relied upon for the long term. 
This is a simple function that builds a .tar.gz archive out of the files, directories and links claimed by an installed package. Original file permissions and ownership will be preserved. It should be easy to build OS-specific binary packages out of these simple binary tarballs. However, also consider using the export installed files list functionality instead. 
If you expected more binary package building functionalities, please remember that this program is source-centered and OS-neutral.

<h2 class="chapter">6 FAQ</h2>

<p>This is a small section in which I try to address common questions.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Q: GNU Source Installer does not install! What should I do?

     <p>A: There are dedicated topics in this manual.

     <p>See <a href="#Introduction-for-Beginners">Installing the Installer</a>. 
<br>
See <a href="#Introduction-for-Beginners">Troubleshooting Installation</a>.

     <li>Q: I have found a bug in GNU Source Installer! What should I do?

     <p>A: By all means, do report it. You will get the problem solved, and the software will become better if users report bugs. 
See <a href="#Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>.

     <li>Q: sourceinstall coud not install Package [:xyz:]. What can I do?

     <p>A: If the package does not provide a build system compatible with <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>, you will get an error message, stating that the program could not compile the code. To get the package supported, you have at least two choices.

     <p>If you are an experienced user, you should contact the original author or maintainer of that package, explaining that you are trying to install it using a new install tool (GNU Source Installer), but it does not work because it does not provide a build system compatible with the idiom:

     <pre class="example">          ./configure
          make
          make install
     </pre>
     <p>Then provide a quick solution for the author, so he will not need any effort to accept the change. If you are not sure, rely on the <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> people to do this for you.

     <p>If you are a little less experienced and do not know how to help the author of the package, just contact the <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> mailing list at <a href="mailto:bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org">bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org</a>. We will contact the package maintainer, and help him make that package work with <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>.

     <li>Q: Why doesn't sourceinstall use Checkinstall?

     <p>A: Checkinstall is a nice program that tracks a source installation using Installwatch, which is Copyright 1998 by Pancrazio `Ezio' de Mauro, and is now part of the Checkinstall distribution. 
Installwatch is a low-level tool that intercepts calls to file functions in the dynamically linked glibc that alter the file system during 'make install' (or another installation command). Then, Checkinstall builds binary Slackware, RPM or Debian packages based on that information.

     <p>Now I find that the DESTDIR and INSTALL_ROOT (its old, deprecated replacement) way used in <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> is more clean and portable (although slower) than the low level installwatch approach, and is an incentive for developers to correctly support DESTDIR in their custom Makefiles or in their automake hooks. <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> detects if the build system supports DESTDIR or the old INSTALL_ROOT variables, and uses them for the installation tracking.

     <p>As for GNU/Linux distribution-specific binary package building features, GNU Source Installer is again an OS neutral program, so it is not its job to build them. However, a functionality to build simple, neutral binary packages in the form of a tarball archive is available. From that package, it should be straightforward to build your desired distribution-specific package, but again it is not the point of this program.

     <li>Q: Does sourceinstall build [:your format:] binary packages ?

     <p>A: (see question above) It has been recently reported that <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> simple binary packages happen to be handled correctly by the Slackware GNU/Linux tools. That is simply because both use plain tarballs which contain the needed files with the original owners and permissions. Remember that building binary packages is not the point of this program (but use this as you see fit of course).

     <li>Q: There's Gentoo and Portage already. Isn't sourceinstall pointless ?

     <p>A: Surprisingly, I got many (well some) private mails stating that there's already the Gentoo GNU/Linux distribution and its Portage system, so <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> was supposedly pointless. Again, this software is an installer and source package management tool, targeted at modern Unix systems (these include, but do not end with GNU/Linux). Of course, <span class="command">sourceinstall</span> is not a GNU/Linux distribution and not a package repository.

     <li>Q: Why are you using Tk? Why don't you use gtk|Qt|[:yourtoolkit:] ?

     <p>A: I do not have any real preference of one toolkit over another. They can all get the job done. However I really wished to use the GNU ToolKit at the beginning (gtk), because it's the GNU ToolKit (talk about tautology). 
There is one problem: dependencies and dependencies' size. I wanted to provide something that you could install from a bare-bones Unix + X11 system requiring nothing else.

     <p>With the current tcl/tk/expect implementation I can provide, in 7 MB, a fullpack alternative shell-archive release of <span class="command">sourceinstall</span>, which includes and autobuilds all its dependencies if necessary. The same thing would not be possible with gtk, which is bigger and less straightforward to autobuild.

     <p>If you want a [:yourtoolkit:] interface to the program badly, you can implement it on top of sourceinstall command line interface (but contact the author so you can get all the help and possibly tweaks to the young interface that you need).

     <li>Q: Why are you using Tcl? Why don't you use [:yourlanghere:] ?

     <p>A: Tcl seemed the natural choice having to deal with both Tk and Expect, and it offered simpler Unix portability. However this could change. I am not happy with some of the tcl decisions, and some bugs in the implementation do not help either. If the whole project language changes, it will change to C.

     <li>Q: I do not care about cross Unix portability, dependencies, building the whole system from scratch or anything like this. Is there an alternative, specific for my already working GNU/Linux desktop system ?

     <p>A: There are projects with somewhat similar goals that I have been made aware of:

     <p>Kconfigure, QT based, for KDE: <a href="http://kconfigure.sourceforge.net/">http://kconfigure.sourceforge.net/</a>

     <p>Easinstaller, Ruby and Fox based: <a href="http://easinstaller.sourceforge.net/">http://easinstaller.sourceforge.net/</a>

     <p>GPaco, Gtk based, for GNU/Linux and Solaris: <a href="http://paco.sourceforge.net/">http://paco.sourceforge.net/</a>

     <p>I know little about them save their name so you should investigate them yourself.

     <li>Q: The manual is not comprensive enough! It does not say anything about [:X:]

     <p>A: The project is still very young, as is the documentation. It will be a lot better; you can speed up things by reporting what exactly is missing, and possibly providing yourself if you have some time.

     <li>Q: This program does not deal with dependencies at all!

     <p>A: This manual will be integrated with a detailed explanation on how to deal with dependencies. With some patience, I think almost everyone can learn to live with them.

     <li>Q: I have an older version of sourceinstall, how do I upgrade to the current version?

     <p>A: Starting from sourceinstall-0.4, this has been made easier. Just download the regular new version (for example, sourceinstall-0.5.tar.gz), then run sourceinstall, and choose &ldquo;Add&rdquo;; select that new sourceinstall package (sourceinstall-0.5.tar.gz), and confirm with Ok. All your installed packages and preferences will not be harmed.

     <li>Q: The right click popup menu does not work (anymore)!

     <p>A: The Tk popup menus (and consequently sourceinstall prior to v-0.5) were not sticky. This means that in order to keep the menu visible, one had to keep the button always pressed. This has been fixed very recently in a development version of Tk.

     <p>In order to offer a more usable popup menu, starting from 0.5 I use a workaround that involves showing the popup on right click button RELEASE. In short: starting with sourceinstall 0.5, click and release the right button on a list entry, and the popup will appear.

     <li>Q: I want to contribute to the project in some way, where do I start?

     <p>A: Start with the Bugs and Task list in the Savannah sourceinstall project page: <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/sourceinstall/">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/sourceinstall/</a> . 
Even if you are not a programmer, the task list can contain very relevant work that does not involve programming or reading code at all.

     <p>If you have an interesting idea to share, by all means do so. You can contact the mailing list <a href="mailto:bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org">bug-sourceinstall@gnu.org</a>, or if you prefer you can contact the author directly at <a href="mailto:claudio@gnu.org">claudio@gnu.org</a>. As long as your mail is polite enough, you will not be judged by me in any way by the ideas you express, even if I do not agree with you.

     <li>Q: I want to join the project! Please add me to the project members list.

     <p>A: Great, but please do something for the project. If you make regular contributions, and understand the project goals, you will be added to the sourceinstall project.

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street - Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
   <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Preamble</h3>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software&mdash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &ldquo;Program&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &ldquo;work based on the Program&rdquo;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.

     <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

     <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

     <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

          <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          </ol>

     <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

     <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

     <li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

          <li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

          <li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          </ol>

     <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

     <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

     <li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

     <li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

     <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

     <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

     <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     <li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

     <li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &ldquo;any
later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

     <li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

     <p><a name="index-no-warranty-104"></a>
<li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     <li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

   <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) 20<var>yy</var>  <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the
     Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     51 Franklin Street - Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19<var>yy</var> <var>name of author</var>
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.
</pre>
   <p>The hypothetical commands <span class="samp">show w</span> and <span class="samp">show c</span> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <span class="samp">show w</span> and
<span class="samp">show c</span>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items&mdash;whatever
suits your program.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre class="smallexample">     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright

</pre>
   <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

<pre class="display">     Copyright (C) 2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     <p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission. 
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement. 
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher. 
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. 
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
I. Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence. 
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 
K. For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;,
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein. 
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 
M. Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version. 
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. 
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&ndash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all sections
Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<pre class="verbatim">
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
    Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with...Texts.'' line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
